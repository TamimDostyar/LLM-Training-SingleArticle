      "schools varied in quality during the Elizabethan era, but the curriculum was\n",

      "wrote them in a stylised language that does not always spring naturally from the\n",
      "needs of the characters or the drama. The poetry depends on extended,\n",
      "sometimes elaborate metaphors and conceits, and the language is often\n",
      "rhetorical—written for actors to declaim rather than speak. The grand speeches\n",
      "in Titus Andronicus, in the view of some critics, often hold up the action, for\n",
      "example; and the verse in The Two Gentlemen of Verona has been described as\n",
      "stilted.\n",
      "Soon, however, Shakespeare began to adapt the traditional styles to his own\n",
      "purposes. The opening soliloquy of Richard III has its roots in the self-declaration\n",
      "of Vice in medieval drama. At the same time, Richard’s vivid self-awareness looks\n",
      "forward to the soliloquies of Shakespeare's mature plays. No single play marks a\n",
      "change from the traditional to the freer style. Shakespeare combined the two\n",

      "mixing of the styles. By the time of Romeo and Juliet, Richard II, and A\n",
      "Midsummer Night's Dream in the mid-1590s, Shakespeare had begun to write a\n",

      "needs of the drama itself.\n",
      "www.PoemHunter.com - The World's Poetry Archive 10\n",
      "Shakespeare's standard poetic form was blank verse, composed in iambic\n",
      "pentameter. In practice, this meant that his verse was usually unrhymed and\n",
      "consisted of ten syllables to a line, spoken with a stress on every second syllable.\n",
      "The blank verse of his early plays is quite different from that of his later ones. It\n",
      "is often beautiful, but its sentences tend to start, pause, and finish at the end of\n",
      "lines, with the risk of monotony. Once Shakespeare mastered traditional blank\n",
      "verse, he began to interrupt and vary its flow. This technique releases the new\n",
      "power and flexibility of the poetry in plays such as Julius Caesar and Hamlet.\n",
      "Shakespeare uses it, for example, to convey the turmoil in Hamlet's mind:\n",
      "Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting\n",
      "That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay\n",
      "Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly—\n",

      "Hamlet, Act 5, Scene 2, 4–8\n",
      "After Hamlet, Shakespeare varied his poetic style further, particularly in the more\n",
      "emotional passages of the late tragedies. The literary critic A. C. Bradley\n",
      "described this style as \"more concentrated, rapid, varied, and, in construction,\n",
      "less regular, not seldom twisted or elliptical\". In the last phase of his career,\n",
      "Shakespeare adopted many techniques to achieve these effects. These included\n",
      "run-on lines, irregular pauses and stops, and extreme variations in sentence\n",
      "structure and length. In Macbeth, for example, the language darts from one\n",
      "unrelated metaphor or simile to another: \"was the hope drunk/ Wherein you\n",
