# LLM Fine-Tuning on a Single Article

This project demonstrates a simple experiment in fine-tuning a language model (specifically GPT-2) on a single article. The goal is to train the model to learn the style and content of the article so that it can generate new, related paragraphs without copying the original text verbatim.

## Overview

- **Objective:** Fine-tune a GPT-2 model on an article to generate new sentences that capture the essence of the original text.
- **Approach:** Use the Hugging Face Transformers library to preprocess the data, fine-tune the model, and generate creative outputs.
- **Note:** Fine-tuning on a single article may lead to overfitting. Experiment with training parameters such as the number of epochs and learning rate to achieve a balance between learning the style and avoiding verbatim copying.
